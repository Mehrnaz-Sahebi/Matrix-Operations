# Linear Algebra Matrix Operations

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook focuses on implementing fundamental matrix operations as part of a practical exploration of **Linear Algebra**. It demonstrates how to perform row operations, solve systems of linear equations, calculate determinants, and optionally visualize results.

## Features
The notebook is divided into the following sections:
1. **Elementary Row Operations**:
   - Scaling
   - Replacement
   - Interchange
2. **Solving Systems of Equations** using manual implementations.
3. **Determinant Calculation**.
4. **Visualization**: Plotting the solution of systems of equations (optional).

## Prerequisites
- **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed with support for running Jupyter Notebooks.
- **No External Libraries**: The implementation must use only standard Python functionality.

## Notebook Structure
- **Section 0: Libraries**: Import necessary modules if required.
- **Section 1: Row Operations**:
  - Scaling
  - Replacement
  - Interchange
- **Section 2: Solving Systems**: Solve linear equations using the row operations.
- **Section 3: Determinants**: Calculate matrix determinants programmatically.
- **Section 4: Visualization (Optional)**: Create visual plots of results.
